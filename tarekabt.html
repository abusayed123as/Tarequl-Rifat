        <p>  My name is tarekul Rifat. I am 18 years old and read in class 11th standard. 
            Iam a junior web developer. I want to be a blockchain developer.
            I am the second child of my parents and I have an elder brother.
            We have a joint family where my grandparents, uncle-aunt, cousins live in the same house. 
            We love each other very much and are closely related to grandparents.
            All family members are open-minded and friendly.
            I have a group of 5 friends however Shihab is my best friend. He is true, honest and looks so nice.
            We both are in the same class and school.  

             Normally, I like to hear and tell jokes and stories to my friends.
             I help my younger cousins in doing their home works daily.
              I love my parents very much. They also love me and promote me to do well in every field. 
              They motivate and inspire me to study. My family is a cultural family. 
              When we celebrate each festival together, we enjoyed it and have a great time.
               Really, I am fortunate to have this family.</p>
